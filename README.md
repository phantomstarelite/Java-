## 🧠 Coding Rules Followed

* One problem = one `.java` file
* Class name = file name
* No unnecessary OOP
* Static methods only
* `main()` used only for testing
* Clear comments for approach & complexity

Example:

```java
// Pattern: Hashing
// Time: O(n)
// Space: O(n)
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run Code (VS Code)

1. Open the `java` folder in VS Code
2. Make sure `src` is set as **source directory**
3. Open any `.java` file
4. Click ▶ **Run**

*No terminal commands needed.*

---

## 📌 Example Problem (Two Sum)

**Problem:**
Given an array of integers and a target, return indices of two numbers that add up to the target.

**Approach Used:**

* HashMap for O(n) solution
* One-pass traversal
