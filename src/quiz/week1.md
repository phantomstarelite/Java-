---

### Q8

In Two Sum, why do we **check first and then put** into HashMap?

Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock allows:

A. Multiple transactions  
B. Only one transaction  
C. Buy after sell  
D. Selling without buy ing

---

### Q12

Why does the greedy approach work for stock profit?

A. Because prices are sorted  
B. Because only one transaction is allowed  
C. Because brute force is easier  
D. Because HashMap is used  

---

# 🟢 SECTION 4 — Greedy & Kadane’s Algorithm

---

### Q15

In Kadane’s algorithm, when do we start a new subarray?

B. When current element is larger than current sum  
C. Always  
D. Never

---

# 🟢 SECTION 5 — Two Pointers & In-Place Logic

### Q16

Two Pointers technique is best when:
